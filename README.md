About
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to highlight my expertise in system development and my passion for security and windows internals. The website is built with a focus on modern web standards, responsiveness, and user experience, featuring a dynamic theme toggle and smooth navigation.

Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Dynamic Theme Toggle: Users can switch between dark and light modes, with the site respecting their system preference by default.

Smooth Scrolling: Enhanced user experience with smooth transitions when navigating between sections.

Interactive Navigation: Active navigation links are highlighted as the user scrolls through sections.

Professional Layout: Clearly structured sections for About, Education, Experience, Projects, and Contact.

Favicon: Dynamic favicon that changes based on the selected theme (dark/light).

Technologies Used
The website is built using a minimal yet powerful stack:

HTML5: For semantic structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive elements, smooth scrolling, and theme toggling logic.

SVG Icons: Used for social links and other visual elements for scalability and crispness.
